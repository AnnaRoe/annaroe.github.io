          <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>In today's age, UX designers can't be successful in finding roles without a solid online portfolio. The objective of Anna Roe | UX was to publish a portfolio website to showcase
            my process, work, and skills. Using my Frontend knowledge, I built my portfolio website from the ground up.

            Here is my process. </p>
          <h5>Goal</h5>
          <p>To build a responsive (mobile-first) UX portfolio website based on HCD methodology and showcase UX portfolio work and process to hiring/product managers.</p>
          <h5>My Process</h5>
          <p>Based on my research of successful UX design portfolios traits, I have applied a human-centered design (HCD) approach to build this UX portfolio website. In the process, I have improved my existing HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS
            (Cascading Style Sheets), and JS (JavaScript) skills.</p>
          <h5>My Tools</h5>

          <p>Figma - Atom - GitHub</p>

              Keeping the goal of this website in mind, I started with a simple question: </p>
            <h4>What are hiring managers and product designers
              looking for in a successful UX portfolio?</h4>
            <p>I have combed the www for the <b>top ten</b> articles and carefully logged every
              UX-related skill keyword. Here are the top three UX-related skills to display
              for a UX portfolio success.</p>

          <p>While improving my HTML/CSS skills using learning platforms such as Codecademy and Udemy, I realized some coding constraints. I decided to pursue a feasible yet impactful design that will allow any visitor to navigate UX portfolio

              Design language's goal was to make an objective website flow for optimal navigation. That way, anyone visiting the portfolio website can easily navigate through and find any information in less than three clicks.</p>
            <p> For that reason, I decided on a monochromatic colors scheme to focus on the information at hand without unnecessary distraction. </p>

              I have chosen the yellow color to symbolize intellect, positivity, and creativity. Type legibility and readability were of high importance as they aligned with the goal

            <p>You’re the Head of Design in a digital agency in the US. You’re currently expanding your UX team and are looking for a junior UI designer with front-end coding skills. Through LinkedIn, you found Anna Roe. You want to take a closer
              look at her online portfolio to understand her style and personality.
            </p>
            <p>Test participants were given three scenarios to complete. At the same time,
              I recorded and observed their behavior around the website’s usability, and I followed up with open-ended questions regarding the website’s visual design. </p>

            <p><b>Scenario 2:</b>You’ve browsed through the project and become more interested in her former education and experiences. Now, you want to see her resume. Where do you think you can find it?</p>
            <p><b>Scenario 3:</b> You’ve downloaded the resume and want to reach out to her to share the current job opening. How might you proceed?</p>

          <h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I enjoy working with people and love learning about people's needs and pain points. 
              Being present, listening carefully, and practicing empathy skills was the most rewarding part. That said, staying subjective and not projecting my biases during the research 
              phase was also somewhat challenging. </li>
            <li>It turns out that I didn't think of all the right questions right off the bat during my first round of surveying, and I realized it is ok to clarify results with additional surveys to achieve 
              a deeper understanding of my target audience.   </li>
            <li>Receiving feedback from my peers, tutor, and mentors was the most energizing aspect. Going back to my process and adjusting my designs according to their valuable feedback helped me grow into a better designer. Yet, I still have a
              lot
              to learn, and that just excites me.</li>
