Hello There,

Welcome to my first Frontend project! I have been self-studying HTML and CSS for the past couple of months, and here is what I have so far. I have some improvements ahead of me, but I love testing and learning from every change I make to this website. And yes, some of these commits' titles are just out of wack. :)
